# Project Arrhythmia in Blender

i have no idea what i'm doing

this should hopefully eventually be a thing that will allow you to import and export levels and prefabs + edit them at *some* point

knowing me it will take forever

feel free to see if i've released a useable version of this [here](https://github.com/technob1scuit/projectarrhythmia-blender/releases)

i absolutely despise python
